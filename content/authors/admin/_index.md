Albert grew up in Kumasi, Ghana. He studied agriculture (agricultural economics major) at the University of Ghana in Accra and graduated with first class honours. He moved to Saskatoon, Canada to study for an Msc degree at the University of Saskatchewan before joining the PhD program at the Department of Resource Economics and Environmental Sociology (REES), University of Alberta (U of A), in Edmonton. While at the U of A, he was an inaugural Teaching Fellow at the Peter Lougheed Leadership College. From Alberta, Albert moved down south to the US to join the University of Wisconsin-River Falls as Assistant Professor in 2017. In 2023, Albert was hired as a Lecturer (US- assistant professor rank) in global agri-food supply chains at Newcastle University in the northern eastern part of England. His research focuses on understanding stakeholder incentives in the uptake of sustainable innovations in livestock supply chains, consumer decision-making pertaining to ethical food attributes and the design of emerging carbon offset schemes in food supply chains.
